Life can be challanging and fun if you love what you are doing. 
Hi,
My Name is Rashmi and I am Devops Engineer. I have started off my carrer as a C and Unix developer. With time I kind of found the build release thing very interesting for many reasons and I gradually started getting involved in Deployment activities and over a period of time I have become a Build engineer and now a DevOps lead.
The best part of working as a DevOps engineer is that you get to work in many tools and technologies.You deal with multiple environments.

And the worst is also the same sometime..
